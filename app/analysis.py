# This is where our data science logic will live. 
# This file won't have any routes. Instead, it will contain Python functions 
# that use Pandas to perform calculations. 
# For example, a function called get_trending_books() could be defined here and 
# then called from the admin.py routes to get the data needed for the dashboard.
