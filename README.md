# libraryApp
Final Project of CS50

    The goal of this project is to create a CRUD university Library app with various features for both 
    Faculty/librarian/Dean and alumni. 
    Some features will use data analysis techniques in order to suggest users 
    what actions to make regarding the library.

    This will be a Python/Flask/MySQL/SQLAlchemy + HTML/vanillaCSS/vanillaJavaScript app.
    Also, I will practice using Git + GitHub in a consistent manner with this project.
